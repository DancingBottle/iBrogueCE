Brogue-iPad
===========

This is the iPad port of Brian Walker's amazing roguelike Brogue which can be found @https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/

Brogue for iPad can be downloaded for free on the iTunes store via your iPad @https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brogue/id613921309?mt=8

This project can be run on iPhone. Change the proj settings to universal and build away. Too small for the app store.
